<h2>Ring Bearer</h2>
<p>The inspiration for me to become a ring bearer started when I was 20 years old. 
	I have never witnessed an older ring bearer at any wedding I have attended 
	and I always wondered why... I have come to the conclusion that there is no
	reason for the lack of 20 year old ring bearers, and thus, I proposed the idea
	to my two great friends Anthony and Julie (as lovely seen in the photos) that 
	I would make a great ring-Bearer. They happened to be in the market as 
	an engaged couple, and decided to risk their luck on me as a ring bearer... 
	Needless to say, it was the best wedding I have ever been apart of.
